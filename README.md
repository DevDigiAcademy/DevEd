# DevEd

Look into our collections of full courseware—ready for adaptation and usage in talks, workshops, classrooms, communities, and clubs. These are student-created sets on certain projects or topics that encompass sample projects, slidedecks, instructor guides, and more. All materials are reusable, editable, and distributable.

Our materials are hosted on the Developh Github (wedeveloph).
