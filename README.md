# DevEd
Look into our collections of full coursewareâ€”ready for adaptation and usage in talks, workshops, classrooms, communities, and clubs. These are student-created sets on certain projects or topics that encompass sample projects, slidedecks, instructor guides, and more. All materials are reusable, editable, and distributable.

Our materials are hosted on the Developers' Society github.

## What is this repository?

Developers' Society's collection of educational materials and resources. Our **courseware and project material** are stored at this repository, but there's so much more!

All materials here are **free and open**. Feel free to send in any edits, add anything, or make your own copy to use and edit for your own learning purposes or for your communities, clubs, or classroom. We specifically want to educate and help all types of learners and groups with our materials.
