# Web Development
These materials involve HTML, CSS, Javascript... and everything else onwards. They are practical as introductory materials for young students.

## Block 1: Introduction
Block 1 is a simple introductory lesson to HTML. Participants create their first webpage, are introduced to the basic formatting styles, classes, and also learn how to style their webpages. It's also easy to modify and alter. For those who want to delve a bit more advanced, exploring more elements and styling techniques is the way to go.

Block 1 covers: Webpage structure, tag syntax, basic elements (formatting, breaks, text), styling, introduction to stylesheets

## Block A: Tips and Tricks
Block A is a special block that covers some advanced tips and tricks, which are basically resources to check out when wishing to make your webpage a bit more advanced. Hexadecimal color code pickers, Google Fonts to make things more pleasing, etc. -- it's not fun to just make plain webpages! 

This can be used in conjunction with as early as Block 1: Introduction.

Block A covers: fonts, colors, transitions, images, etc.
